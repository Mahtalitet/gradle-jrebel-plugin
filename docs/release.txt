NB! Build with Gradle 1.0-milestone-6 or higher

!! You need to install PGP on your computer and generate PGP keys before making your first 
!! release. The procedure is described here: 
!! https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/How+To+Generate+PGP+Signatures+With+Maven
!!
!! Remember the passphrase of your PGP keys, it will be used in release process.

!!

Do not forget to put "gradle.properties" into your %HOMEPATH%/.gradle directory
and store the following properties:

nexusReleasesUsername = <nexus username for release repository>
nexusReleasesPassword = <nexus password for release repository>

nexusSnapshotsUsername = <nexus username for snapshots repository>
nexusSnapshotsPassword = <nexus password for snapshots repository>

signing.keyId = <the public key ID (an 8 character hexadecimal string)>
signing.password = <the passphrase used to protect your private key>
signing.secretKeyRingFile = <the absolute path to the secret key ring file containing your private key, like C:/Users/Igor Bljahhin/AppData/Roaming/gnupg/secring.gpg>

!!
